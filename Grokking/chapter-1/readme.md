## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or perform a task. It is a set of instructions that can be followed to achieve a specific goal.

## Why Learn Algorithms?

Understanding algorithms is crucial for efficient problem-solving and optimizing code performance. They are fundamental to computer science and are used in various applications, from search engines to data processing.

## Basic Algorithm Examples

- **Binary Search**: A fast search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Exercises

1. Implement a binary search algorithm in Python.
2. Write a Python function to perform bubble sort on a list of numbers.

Happy Coding!
