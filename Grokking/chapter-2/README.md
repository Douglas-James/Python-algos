# Chapter 2 - Grokking Algorithms

This chapter contains Python implementations of basic algorithms.

## Files

1. **findSmallest.py** - This script contains a function to find the smallest value in an array.
2. **selectionSort.py** - This script uses the `findSmallest` function to sort an array using the selection sort algorithm.

## Descriptions

### findSmallest.py

This file includes a function that iterates through an array to find and return the smallest value.

### selectionSort.py

This file implements the selection sort algorithm. It repeatedly finds the smallest element using the `findSmallest` function and sorts the array.

## Usage

To run these scripts, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
python3 findSmallest.py
python3 selectionSort.py
```

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Happy Coding!
