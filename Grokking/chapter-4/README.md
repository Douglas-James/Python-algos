# Chapter 4: Quick Sort

This chapter focuses on Quick Sort. Choosing the pivot is important, but we will brush up on that later. For now, we will use the following approach:

1. Recurse on the left array (elements less than the pivot)
2. Add the pivot
3. Recurse on the right array (elements greater than the pivot)

Stay tuned for more details on selecting the optimal pivot!
