# Grokking Algorithms (Second Edition) - Python Examples

This repository contains Python examples from the book **Grokking Algorithms (Second Edition)**. Each chapter is organized into its own folder, and the Python files include simple comments explaining the code.

## Structure

The repository is divided into 13 folders, each corresponding to a chapter from the book:

```
chapters/
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter_01
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter_02
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter_03
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Chapter_13
```

### What Youâ€™ll Find

- **Python Files:** Each chapter folder contains Python scripts demonstrating algorithms and concepts covered in that chapter.
- **Comments:** Every script includes comments to make the code easy to understand.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder of the chapter you are interested in.
2. Explore the Python files to learn the algorithms and concepts.
3. Run the code to experiment and deepen your understanding.
